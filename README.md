This is the blog I made after studying from course below.
If you are interested in learning, I recommend you can learn a lot from [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?

All the page you see will be only 1 page, so it is a Single Page Application

The stack behind this:
React

Redux

Axios - http ajax request helper

Lodash - utility tool for handling Object and Array

react-router-dom - client side router

redux-form - form handling

Bootstrap - css style

I practice based on the API provided in http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/
However, since it does not allow CORS, I change to use http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

This is code on http://c9.io/

You clone the repository from here in your c9 virtual machine and run below command:

> npm install
> npm run start

Have fun
